This repo will focus on filtering and sorting the Chicago public tarball data.
So far I have not used wget to obtain the dataset, and currently have the portion I need already downloaded.

Steps to manipulate data:
1. Slice date range
2. Remove outliers (outlierScript)
3. Split into separate folders based on node 

**Check to see if all nodes span this time frame?**
4. Do analysis

... still only working on removing outliers but I'm close
